### Case of Alignment Data

In the following table, we provide a specific example of the final constructed alignment data. This data is represented as a quadruple \((x, y_c, y_r, \delta)\), where:

- \(x\): The input consisting of a rephrasing instruction and the human-written content to be rewritten.
- \(y_c\): The chosen (preferred) response.
- \(y_r\): The rejected (non-preferred) response.
- \(\delta\): The fine-grained preference difference provided by the IR model.

### Case Studies

Tables below present comparisons of human-written documents with LLM-generated documents across various datasets (SciFact, NQ, and TREC-COVID). The experimental results show that the alignment task results in minor word choice and stylistic changes, maintaining the quality of LLM-generated content. This demonstrates that the alignment task enables the LLM to effectively emulate human style with reduced source bias.

| **Human**      | GGene expression is a fundamentally stochastic process, with randomness in transcription and translation leading to cell-to-cell variations in mRNA and protein levels. This variation appears in organisms ranging from microbes to metazoans, and its characteristics depend both on the biophysical parameters governing gene expression and on gene network structure. Stochastic gene expression has important consequences for cellular function, being beneficial in some contexts and harmful in others. These situations include the stress response, metabolism, development, the cell cycle, circadian rhythms, and aging. |
| **Raw Llama3** | Gene expression is a naturally unpredictable process, with random fluctuations in transcription and translation resulting in varying levels of mRNA and protein between individual cells. This variability is observed across a wide range of organisms, from microorganisms to complex multicellular organisms, and is influenced by both the physical properties that govern gene expression and the structure of gene networks. The stochastic nature of gene expression has significant implications for cellular function, sometimes being advantageous and other times detrimental. This is evident in various biological processes, including the stress response, metabolic pathways, development, cell division, circadian rhythms, and the aging process. |
| **Llama3 + SFT** | Gene expression is a random process that occurs in cells, leading to variations in the amount of mRNA and protein produced. This randomness is seen in all living things, from tiny bacteria to complex animals, and is influenced by the physical rules that govern gene expression and the way genes are connected. This randomness can have different effects on the cell, sometimes helping it to function properly and other times causing problems. This is important in various cellular processes, such as responding to stress, regulating metabolism, developing into different cell types, controlling the cell cycle, maintaining daily rhythms, and affecting aging. |
| **Llama3 + DPO** |  The process of gene expression is inherently unpredictable, with fluctuations in transcription and translation causing distinct differences in mRNA and protein levels from one cell to another. This variability is observed across a wide range of organisms, from microorganisms to complex multicellular creatures, and is influenced by both the physical factors that regulate gene expression and the intricate network of genes at play. The stochastic nature of gene expression has significant implications for cellular function, sometimes proving advantageous and other times detrimental. This is evident in various biological processes, such as the stress response, metabolism, development, the cell cycle, circadian rhythms, and the aging process. |
